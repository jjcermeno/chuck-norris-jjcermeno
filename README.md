## Before coding

After reading carefully the coding challenge proposal I started to think about it. At first glance it was kind of easy and quite straightforward. The following this is what I understood and some of the ideas I started to have on how I could solve it (it may change later, I will document it anyway):

- we have **users that perform a search** (use case)
- results to the search should be paginated (API pagination)
- search and results should be stored in database
- results, optionally, should be sent by email if email address is provided (I would use background jobs â†’sidekiq and mailer)
- app should present interface in English/Spanish (locales)
- mandatory use of Docker
- **results come from an external API.** I would use an API wrapper. Because I am going with Ruby on Rails for the back end I can use `Faraday` or `RestClient` to build one, instead of relaying in a gem like `ApiStruct` just to show some coding skills or sense of organization/architecture
- I would use `Rspec` for tests, and `WebMock` to test the API wrapper and use mocked responses
- I never used before but started to learn two years ago about `Vue.js` I will go with this, just for pure fun.

So, nothing complex, just perform a search obtaining results from an external API, apply some conditions and done, right? Not so fast my friend. Devil lives in the details. We are not just returning what we get from an external API, we need to store it and then serve it, probably after some processing. Pagination is asking for this behavior, specifically when asking for random jokes, every time we request to external API we can get different result and exercise tell us to paginate result, so we have to store the search and the results so the front end can ask for specific page. The exercise is not difficult but to complete we have lots of moving parts:

- connecting to external API and handling errors
- saving results by converting to our internal data model
- responding to our users' requests validating them
- sending emails with results that implies to use background jobs if we don't want to block our app

## Architecture

I will try to use Clean Architecture, specifically the use of Interactors (or use cases), Forms (for incoming data validation from front end requests), Repositories (to read and save to a persistent storage system) and probably DTOs.

I think I will prepare 4 use cases: 

- getting categories (filling database if no category found, started by frontend)
- create search
- get all searches (paginated)
- get search and its results (paginated)

I think that one of the best ways to use Rails is using use-case oriented Rails. This way we can have any feature we want and conveniently decoupled so we can build features based on other features. Furthermore, we can do it in a very verbose way, like plain English, very easy to understand, thus to maintain.

Main endpoints identified so far:

- GET /api/v1/categories
- POST /api/v1/search
- GET /api/v1/searches
- GET /api/v1/searches/{id}

## Use Cases

### Getting CN Fact Categories

Because we can get Chuck Norris facts from the external API (cn_api) by searching categories, we need to get them and populate our database, so we can save time, don't need to get categories every time user perform a search by using categories.

So the workflow is:

- get categories (GET /api/v1/categories) endpoint is reached
- then, GetCategories use case is called
- use case doesn't need any input so it's going to get categories from the API wrapper directly
- if need it, it will fill database with non existing categories
- once done, use case will return all categories list

### Create New Search

### Get all searched performed so far (not the results, paginated)

### Get (specific) Search results, paginated

 

# Building the solution

First of all I will create a repo in GitHub that will contain code for both back and front end codes. Then I will create a Makefile, that will help us with frequently used commands) and a docker-compose file. 

As I said for back end I will use Ruby on Rails 6 API mode and PostgreSQL as database (it could be SQLite but we are using docker so, no problem and very near to production ready), Redis database for sidekiq background jobs engine (for sending emails) and Vue.js in the front end.

## Setting up environments with Docker & Docker Compose

Docker, Docker Compose

Docker version 19.03.12-ce

docker-compose version 1.27.4

Folder for back end based in Ruby on Rails: api mode, postgres, sidekiq and redis

Folder for front end based in Vue.js
